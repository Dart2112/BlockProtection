Credits:
-
		Kanlaki101: BlockProtection was made from the ashes of an inactive plugin called OwnBlocks by cvenomz.
		I have attempted to fix up/recode as much as possible to keep up with the changes to Bukkit.
		All existing code is credited to cvenomz.
		
		Blackwolf12333: I edited this plugin to work with the latest versions of bukkit, but the biggest part
		of the source is written by Kanlaki101 and cvenomz.
